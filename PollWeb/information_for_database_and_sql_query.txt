In db we have 3 coloum:
✅ POLL → stores the question

✅ POLL_OPTIONS → stores the answer options

✅ POLL_VOTES → stores the votes per option

Show Options and Votes for a Specific Poll (e.g., Poll ID = 1):

SELECT 
    p.QUESTION AS poll_question,
    o.OPTION_TEXT AS option_text,
    COUNT(v.ID) AS vote_count
FROM POLL p
JOIN POLL_OPTIONS o ON p.ID = o.POLL_ID
LEFT JOIN POLL_VOTES v ON o.ID = v.OPTION_ID
WHERE p.ID = 1
GROUP BY p.QUESTION, o.OPTION_TEXT;
